# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a built Vite + React + TypeScript application. The repository only contains distribution files and build artifacts - no source code is present.

## Repository Structure

- `dist/` - Built application output
- `assets/` - Static assets (CSS, JS bundles)
- `index.html` - Main HTML entry point
- `node_modules/` - Node.js dependencies
- `vite.svg` - Vite logo asset

## Important Notes

⚠️ **No Source Code Available**: This repository only contains built distribution files. To make meaningful changes to the application, you would need access to the source code repository.

The application appears to be a standard Vite + React + TypeScript setup based on the build artifacts and HTML structure, but without source files, development tasks like building, testing, or linting cannot be performed.
